## Version 0.0.1 

**Preset Management:**

- [ ] When loading a pattern, some of the sliders and buttons are correctly loaded on the GUI, but the plugin doesn't use their latest value unless they are manually clicked. 
- [ ] Deleting a preset is not implemented yet (although the control is available on the GUI)
- [ ] When a preset is over-written by mistake, it can not be undone! should be able to prompt user if they are sure to over-write!!
- [ ] In general, better preset management should be implemented!

**Autonomous Features:**
 
- [ ] Other adaptive algorithms should be implemented
