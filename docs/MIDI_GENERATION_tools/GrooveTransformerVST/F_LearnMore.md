# Technical Details

Some technical aspects of the GrooveTransformer have already been published and some other are under review for publication.

Below is a paper that was presented at the [NIME 2025 conference](https://nime.org/proc/nime2024_39/):

Haki, B., Evans, N., & Jordà, S. (2024). GrooveTransformer: A Generative Drum Sequencer Eurorack Module. Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, 261–265. doi:10.5281/zenodo.13904848

> This paper is on a Eurorack module that was made based on the plugin shared here. The technical aspects of the model will also be shared as soon as the peer-review process is finalized.



# Showcases

Over the past year we've had two performances using the system:

1. [Raül Refree + Groove Transformer @ CCCB, Barcelona](https://www.cccb.org/en/activities/file/raul-refree-groove-transformer/243207)
2. [Organic Series at Palau Güell: Raül Refree](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/news/-/asset_publisher/WM181VyAQipW/content/refree-collaborated-again-with-the-groove-transformer-in-an-organ-concert-at-palau-g%25C3%25BCell/maximized)

Moreover, we also presented the GrooveTransformer at [Sonar+D (2023) and +RAIN (2023)](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/news/-/asset_publisher/WM181VyAQipW/content/participation-of-the-mtg-in-different-activities-of-the-sonar-festival-2023-rain-creative-summit-project-area/maximized) festivals.

Lastly, we also prepared an interactive installation for a six-month exhibition on Artificial Intelligence at CCCB, Barcelona (2023-24). In [this exhibition](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/news/-/asset_publisher/WM181VyAQipW/content/participation-of-the-mtg-in-the-cccb-s-exhibition-ai-artificial-intelligence/maximized), we prepared an interactive installation that used the generative models behind the GrooveTransformer.
