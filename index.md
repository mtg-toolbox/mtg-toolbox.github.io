# MTG Toolbox: Free and Open-Source Audio & MIDI Tools by the Music Technology Group

{: .fs-9 }




[//]: # (## About)
[//]: # ({: .fs-9 })

[//]: # (<br>)



{: .fs-5 }
Over the past few years, we have embarked on research projects aimed at developing creative tools and technologies for music and sound.
Although we are active in the academic community, we recognize that many of our initiatives remain solely within an academic context, with limited engagement from the broader music and sound community. 

{: .fs-5 }
Ofcourse, this is partially a matter of time and resources, as we are a small team with limited capacity to develop and maintain tools. 
Regardless, this is a significant issue, as the technologies we develop have the potential to inspire and support creativity well beyond academic settings.

{: .fs-5 }
To address this, we launched this platform to ensure that tools developed at MTG—whether for composition, performance, analysis, or sound design—are shared in an easy-to-access way. 
Our aim is to make these tools available to a wide audience, from professionals in the field to enthusiasts and curious newcomers.

{: .fs-5 }
In turn, we hope to receive feedback and suggestions from the community to improve our tools, making them more relevant and useful across a diverse range of creative practices.

## What Can Be Found Here?

{: .fs-5 }
We aim to make our internally developed tools easily accessible by offering them in familiar and practical formats—such as VST plugins, web applications, standalone software, and Max/Pd externals. 
Many of these tools are still evolving, so your feedback and suggestions are incredibly valuable. In return, we’re committed to refining and shaping each tool to better serve the broader music and sound community.

{: .fs-5 }
All the tools provided here are free and open-source. This means that none of the tools are locked behind paywalls or subscriptions, and you can freely use, modify, and share them (as long as you respect the corresponding licenses).

{: .fs-5 }
We are also committed to keeping the tools up to date and relevant (as much as our resources allow). Moreover, for each tool, we provide thorough documentation, including installation instructions, usage guides, and examples to help you get started.

## How to Get Involved?

{: .fs-5 }
Each tool is maintained by a dedicated group of researchers, and you’ll find the relevant contact details on the individual project pages. 
We welcome your feedback, ideas, and questions—whether you're a musician, sound designer, researcher, or simply curious. 
Most importantly, we encourage active participation: if you're interested in contributing or collaborating, don’t hesitate to reach out to the appropriate project team.

## What's Next?

{: .fs-5 }
Over the coming year, we plan to release a variety of new tools currently in development. 
Stay tuned for updates on this page or follow us on social media for the latest news. We look forward to sharing our progress and continuing to grow this community together.
