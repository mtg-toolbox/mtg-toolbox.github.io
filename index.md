# MTG Toolbox: Free and Open-Source Audio & MIDI Tools by the Music Technology Group

{: .fs-9 }




[//]: # (## About)
[//]: # ({: .fs-9 })

[//]: # (<br>)




{: .fs-5 }
Over the past few years, we have embarked on research projects focusing on the creative applications of machine learning in music and sound. 
Although we are active in the academic community, we have recognized that many of our initiatives remain within a research bubble, with little engagement from the wider music and sound community. This is a significant issue, as the technologies we develop can have a far-reaching impact beyond academia.

{: .fs-5 }
To address this, we launched this platform to ensure that tools developed at MTG are shared in an easy-to-access manner, so that everyone, whether professionals in the field or simply enthusiasts, can interact with them.

{: .fs-5 }
In turn, we hope to receive feedback and suggestions from the community to improve our tools, making them more relevant and useful to a wider audience.

## About Us

{: .fs-5 }
We are a team of researchers at the [Music Technology Group (MTG)](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg), an academic research institution at the intersection of sound, music, and technology. Our team comprises researchers, engineers, developers, and musicians working together to advance innovative technologies. MTG has a long-standing commitment to creating platforms and tools that are accessible to a broad audience; projects such as [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) and [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/) exemplify our dedication to open-source and open-access research.

## What Can Be Found Here?

{: .fs-5 }
We aim to share our internal developments in forms that are straightforward to set up and use—such as VST plugins, web applications, standalone software, or Max/Pd externals. Because many of these tools are still under active development, we greatly value your feedback and suggestions. In return, we will strive to make each tool as relevant and useful to the larger community as possible.

## How to Get Involved?

{: .fs-5 }
Each tool is overseen by a different group of researchers. You can find the relevant contact information on each project’s page. Feel free to reach out with feedback, ideas, or questions. We hope these resources prove beneficial to musicians, sound designers, and researchers alike. Most importantly, we encourage active participation in our research efforts: if you’d like to become a contributor or collaborator, just contact the appropriate project team.

## What's Next?

{: .fs-5 }
Over the coming year, we plan to release a variety of new tools currently in development. Stay tuned for updates on this page or follow us on social media for the latest news. We look forward to sharing our progress and continuing to grow this community together.

[//]: # (Over the past few years, we have had a growing number of research projects that have been focused on the creative applications of machine learning in the context of music and sound. )

[//]: # (While active in the academic community, we've come to realize that a good deal of works potentially happen in a research bubble, with little to no interaction with the wider music and sound community. )

[//]: # (This is a major problem because certainly the technologies we develop potentially have major implications for the wider community. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (As such, we need to do a better job of ensuring that we somehow include the public in our research efforts, in order to ensure that our outputs are relevant and useful beyond the academic community.)

[//]: # (To this end, we have started the `GAMA` initiative &#40;Generative Audio & MIDI for All&#41;. The aim of this initiative is to ensure that the generative tools developed at the MTG are accessible to the public at large in a manner that is easy to access.)
